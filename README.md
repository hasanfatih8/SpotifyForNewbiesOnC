I was asked to read a bunch of lines of words from a .txt file and put them into nodes in the allocated memory. These nodes are connected next to each other and it shows us how linked lists works.  
In this code, I didn't have time to finish my homework so we have some bugs in it. I hope I will fix and upload it asap.  
I hope you enjoy these songs:
